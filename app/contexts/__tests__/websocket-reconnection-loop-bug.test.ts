/**
 * Test for WebSocket reconnection loop bug
 *
 * This test demonstrates the specific issue where:
 * 1. GameContext useEffect triggers on connectionStatus === "connected"
 * 2. It sends RECONNECT message to server
 * 3. Server responds with RECONNECTED message
 * 4. RECONNECTED message processing causes connection status updates
 * 5. This triggers the useEffect again, creating an infinite loop
